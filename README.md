# Dode the Creeps

Source code for the  "Your first game" tutorial over at [Godot Docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html). Most of the code and setup is a direct copy of the tutorial, with a few changes here and there as I learn.

My goal is to do game development in C++, not because it's better; simply becaus I like C++ and want to use it ;)

## Compiling

1) get Godot game engine v3.1
2) open the project
3) hit run
